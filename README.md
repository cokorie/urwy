# UrWy

### __Doing things your way... That's our way!__

UrWy is a freelance bidding platform, used to connect those in need of a service with specialists of what needs to be done. The service is posted on the platform in the form of a Task, which in turn leads the user to a page to bid into the oppurtunity to perform the Task for a bidded amount.

All users will have access to the general posted Tasks page, the bidding page for the given Task, a page to view any Tasks they have posted to the general Tasks page, a page to create a given Task & a page to create a category of specialty for the Task.

The general Tasks page will list each of the Tasks that have been posted to the platform. Users will only be able to view the Tasks which were posted by others, so not to bid on any of their own.  

The bidding page will allow a user to cast their bid for the chance to give service to another user, with the lowest bid winning the opportunity. Each of the bids will also be posted to the page as well.

On the user's "My Tasks" page, they will be able to view each of their created Tasks, as well as being able to edit & delete the information for them as well.

The "Create Task" page will allow the user to create & post a new post for others to bid upon. There is also a button on the page to take the user to the "Create Category" page, if the specialized category can not be referenced for creating the Task.
